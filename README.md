# Collatz Sequence
### What is it?
The _Collatz Sequence_ has been called the, "simplest impossible math problem
."
### How does it work?
Behind the scenes, the Collatz Sequence takes a given number and, if it's
 even, divides it by two (the program uses `// 2` to round things down); if
  it's odd, it's multiplied by three and one is added to the result. If we
   keep pushing the number through this process, the ultimate result will
    always be one. No one is very sure why!
