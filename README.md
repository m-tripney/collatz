# Collatz Sequence
### What is it?
The _Collatz Sequence_ is a mathematical conjecture, once called the "simplest impossible math problem."

We start with any positive integer, _n_. This is the original term. For each term which follows, we apply the
 following rules: if the previous term (or the original term) is even, the following term is one half the previous
  term; if the previous term is odd, the following term is 3 times the previous term, plus 1. The conjecture posits
   that, no matter the original value of _n_, the ultimate result is always 1... The problem, though, is that no one
    has yet been able to prove that this holds true for _all_ positive integers. Try it and see!
